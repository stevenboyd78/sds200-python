# Roadmap

This document records ordered work planned for `sds200-python`. Listed items are
not available until they appear in a released changelog. Milestone order may
change as hardware validation, protocol research, and user feedback produce new
information.

The broader product direction, architectural constraints, deferred capabilities,
and ideas that are not ready for scheduling are recorded in
[the project vision](docs/project-vision.md).

## Active milestone

### Milestone 18.5 — Pluggable local playback and subscriber health

- **Renderer-neutral playback lifecycle — planned**
  - Define typed contracts for local playback adapter creation, PCM delivery,
    lifecycle state, interruption, and bounded finalization.
  - Separate bounded newest-audio buffering, mute behavior, and playback
    statistics from backend-specific device or process operations.
  - Preserve `SoundDevicePlaybackSink` compatibility and current PortAudio
    CLI and TUI behavior.
- **Local playback adapters — planned**
  - Rebuild the existing sounddevice/PortAudio implementation on the shared
    playback lifecycle without changing its default-device or explicit-device
    behavior.
  - Add explicit PipeWire, PulseAudio, and ALSA adapters while retaining
    bounded nonblocking submission and newest-audio overflow behavior.
  - Provide clear missing-runtime and startup diagnostics plus injectable
    adapter or process factories for hardware-independent tests.
  - Do not add automatic backend fallback or layered saved configuration in
    this milestone.
- **Per-subscriber health and isolation — planned**
  - Move dynamic PCM subscriber routing out of the TUI layer into a reusable
    renderer-neutral service.
  - Add immutable per-subscriber snapshots, lifecycle health, ordered
    transition events, counters, timestamps, and redacted last-error state.
  - Isolate transition listeners and subscriber startup, submission, and
    shutdown failures from every other subscriber.
  - Preserve the invariant that playback and subscriber failures never stop
    RTP reception or interrupt scanner control.
- **Compatibility and scope — planned**
  - Keep existing live playback, warm mute and resume, saved-recording
    playback, WAV recording, and one-session fanout behavior unchanged.
  - Add bounded-buffer, overflow, underflow, startup, runtime failure,
    interruption, shutdown, listener-isolation, and compatibility tests.
  - Leave daemon ownership, local API subscriptions, layered configuration,
    and automatic backend selection for Milestone 19.

## Deferred hardware validation

### SDS150 physical validation

Physical SDS150 validation is deferred until representative hardware is available.
It does not block v0.16.0.

When hardware becomes available:

- validate model detection and USB serial control;
- validate battery and charge reporting;
- validate navigation and PSI state;
- record tested firmware and transport evidence;
- document any limits that differ from modeled or fixture-tested behavior.

Until then, documentation must describe SDS150 support as implemented or
fixture-tested, not hardware-validated.

## Future milestone candidates

These milestone groups preserve intended future work. Their numbering and release
assignment may change before implementation begins.

### Milestone 19 — Layered configuration, daemon, and local API

- Adopt `sdsctl` as the user-facing configuration and service namespace.
- Support layered configuration with precedence:
  defaults, system configuration, user configuration, environment, then CLI.
- Use `/etc/sdsctl/` for system configuration.
- Use `~/.config/sdsctl/` for user configuration.
- Use `~/.local/state/sdsctl/` for persistent user state.
- Use `~/.cache/sdsctl/` for disposable cached data.
- Detect legacy `sds200` configuration and provide a safe migration path.
- Add a long-running daemon that owns scanner, PSI, the SDS200's single
  RTSP/RTP audio session, recording, and remote destination sessions.
- Add bounded PCM and PCMU subscriptions so multiple local clients share one
  scanner audio connection.
- Add a local API and event stream suitable for CLI, TUI, web, and integrations.
- Allow CLI and TUI clients to use daemon-owned sessions while retaining an
  explicit standalone fallback.
- Keep the existing Python import package compatible until a separate migration
  plan justifies a rename.

### Milestone 20 — Web dashboard and Home Assistant

- Add a responsive browser dashboard backed by the daemon API.
- Bind to localhost by default.
- Require explicit authentication and transport-security planning before remote
  exposure.
- Expose scanner state, connection health, audio state, recordings, logs, and safe
  controls.
- Add Home Assistant integration through the daemon API rather than opening a
  second scanner connection.
- Evaluate HACS distribution after the integration contract stabilizes.

### Milestone 21 — Favorites Workspace foundation

- Add a renderer-neutral Favorites data model.
- Add read-only hierarchy browsing for Favorites Lists, systems, departments,
  sites, and channels.
- Add search, filtering, validation, and comparison views.
- Add import and export formats that preserve unknown scanner fields.
- Keep the first implementation read-only against scanner storage.
- Use fixtures and copied storage images for normal automated tests.

### Milestone 22 — Verified Favorites writes and storage backends

- Add create, edit, and delete workflows with explicit previews.
- Support USB mass-storage discovery and safe device handling.
- Support FTP only on trusted local networks or VPNs.
- Require a complete backup before every write operation.
- Stage writes away from the active data set.
- Read back and verify staged content before replacement.
- Record rollback manifests and restore instructions.
- Detect concurrent changes and refuse ambiguous overwrites.
- Keep write operations deterministic, recoverable, and auditable.

### Milestone 23 — External Favorites data and synchronization

- Add RadioReference-assisted import with update previews.
- Preserve provenance and field ownership for externally sourced data.
- Support merge decisions and detaching local records from an external source.
- Store credentials and application keys outside exported Favorites data.
- Investigate MyRR synchronization only through an approved and documented
  interface.
- Do not scrape or depend on undocumented private interfaces.

### Milestone 24 — Advanced protocol and analysis modes

Research and fixture work must precede public support for:

- Favorites and hierarchy retrieval such as `GLT`;
- Favorites quick keys such as `FQK`;
- Quick Search control such as `QSH`;
- scanner recording control such as `URC`;
- analysis controls such as `AST` and `APR`;
- waterfall data such as `PWF` and `GWF`;
- menu operations such as `MNU`, `MSI`, `MSV`, and `MSB`;
- additional NAC, RAN, color-code, area, activity, and quality details;
- conventional and trunking discovery modes;
- system-status and RF-power plot screens.

Each feature must preserve unknown fields and include captured or synthetic
fixtures before renderer-specific implementation.

### Milestone 25 — Portability and additional interfaces

- Continue prioritizing Linux and Raspberry Pi operation.
- Validate Windows and macOS behavior without blocking current releases.
- Consider a future desktop GUI over the same renderer-neutral services.
- Preserve the option for an LCARS-inspired interface theme.
- Prefer scalable SVG assets and responsive layouts.
- Treat the Raspberry Pi 7-inch 800 by 480 display as a compact reference layout,
  not a universal fixed resolution.

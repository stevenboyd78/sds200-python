# Roadmap

This document records ordered work planned for `sds200-python`. Listed items are
not available until they appear in a released changelog. Milestone order may
change as hardware validation, protocol research, and user feedback produce new
information.

The broader product direction, architectural constraints, deferred capabilities,
and ideas that are not ready for scheduling are recorded in
[the project vision](docs/project-vision.md).

## Active milestone

### Milestone 19.12 — v0.19.0 release

- **Compatibility, migration, deployment, and systemd documentation — complete**
  - Documented preserved distribution, import-package, executable, and legacy
    profile compatibility.
  - Documented explicit destination manifests, service accounts, private
    sockets, `SIGHUP` reload, systemd operation, upgrades, and rollback.
- **Acceptance validation — active**
  - Completed adversarial regression validation for multiple, slow, malformed,
    and excess clients plus shutdown fault injection.
  - Completed preliminary source and wheel builds, Twine checks, artifact
    inspection, clean installation, and public-to-local upgrade validation.
  - Validated the repository's existing GitHub CodeQL default setup for Actions
    and Python; repeat package validation against `0.19.0`, run the full Python
    3.11–3.14 CI matrix, and complete final physical SDS200 daemon-owned CLI and
    TUI client validation.
- **Publication — pending**
  - Merge release preparation only after CI and CodeQL pass.
  - Publish `v0.19.0` through trusted PyPI publishing and create the GitHub
    release.
  - Verify a clean installation from public PyPI.

Keep the existing Python distribution and import package compatible until a
separate migration plan justifies a rename.

## Deferred hardware validation

### SDS150 physical validation

Physical SDS150 validation is deferred until representative hardware is available.
It does not block v0.16.0.

When hardware becomes available:

- validate model detection and USB serial control;
- validate battery and charge reporting;
- validate navigation and PSI state;
- record tested firmware and transport evidence;
- document any limits that differ from modeled or fixture-tested behavior.

Until then, documentation must describe SDS150 support as implemented or
fixture-tested, not hardware-validated.

## Future milestone candidates

These milestone groups preserve intended future work. Their numbering and release
assignment may change before implementation begins.

### Milestone 20 — Web dashboard and Home Assistant

- Add a responsive browser dashboard backed by the daemon API.
- Bind to localhost by default.
- Require explicit authentication and transport-security planning before remote
  exposure.
- Expose scanner state, connection health, audio state, recordings, logs, and safe
  controls.
- Add Home Assistant integration through the daemon API rather than opening a
  second scanner connection.
- Evaluate HACS distribution after the integration contract stabilizes.

### Milestone 21 — Favorites Workspace foundation

- Add a renderer-neutral Favorites data model.
- Add read-only hierarchy browsing for Favorites Lists, systems, departments,
  sites, and channels.
- Add search, filtering, validation, and comparison views.
- Add import and export formats that preserve unknown scanner fields.
- Keep the first implementation read-only against scanner storage.
- Use fixtures and copied storage images for normal automated tests.

### Milestone 22 — Verified Favorites writes and storage backends

- Add create, edit, and delete workflows with explicit previews.
- Support USB mass-storage discovery and safe device handling.
- Support FTP only on trusted local networks or VPNs.
- Require a complete backup before every write operation.
- Stage writes away from the active data set.
- Read back and verify staged content before replacement.
- Record rollback manifests and restore instructions.
- Detect concurrent changes and refuse ambiguous overwrites.
- Keep write operations deterministic, recoverable, and auditable.

### Milestone 23 — External Favorites data and synchronization

- Add RadioReference-assisted import with update previews.
- Preserve provenance and field ownership for externally sourced data.
- Support merge decisions and detaching local records from an external source.
- Store credentials and application keys outside exported Favorites data.
- Investigate MyRR synchronization only through an approved and documented
  interface.
- Do not scrape or depend on undocumented private interfaces.

### Milestone 24 — Advanced protocol and analysis modes

Research and fixture work must precede public support for:

- Favorites and hierarchy retrieval such as `GLT`;
- Favorites quick keys such as `FQK`;
- Quick Search control such as `QSH`;
- scanner recording control such as `URC`;
- analysis controls such as `AST` and `APR`;
- waterfall data such as `PWF` and `GWF`;
- menu operations such as `MNU`, `MSI`, `MSV`, and `MSB`;
- a guarded SDS200 reboot-recovery operation based on the reported `MSM,1`
  behavior, which places the scanner in mass-storage mode briefly before reboot;
  require protocol and firmware validation, explicit operator intent, bounded
  outage handling, and post-reboot control, PSI, and RTSP recovery checks before
  exposing it, and do not treat it as ordinary reconnect;
- additional NAC, RAN, color-code, area, activity, and quality details;
- conventional and trunking discovery modes;
- system-status and RF-power plot screens.

Each feature must preserve unknown fields and include captured or synthetic
fixtures before renderer-specific implementation.

### Milestone 25 — Portability and additional interfaces

- Continue prioritizing Linux and Raspberry Pi operation.
- Validate Windows and macOS behavior without blocking current releases.
- Consider a future desktop GUI over the same renderer-neutral services.
- Preserve the option for an LCARS-inspired interface theme.
- Prefer scalable SVG assets and responsive layouts.
- Treat the Raspberry Pi 7-inch 800 by 480 display as a compact reference layout,
  not a universal fixed resolution.

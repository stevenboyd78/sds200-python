# Roadmap

This document records ordered work planned for `sds200-python`. Listed items are
not available until they appear in a released changelog. Milestone order may
change as hardware validation, protocol research, and user feedback produce new
information.

The broader product direction, architectural constraints, deferred capabilities,
and ideas that are not ready for scheduling are recorded in
[the project vision](docs/project-vision.md).

## Active milestone

### Milestone 19.7 — Bounded PCMU client subscriptions

- **Accepted PCMU packet fanout — complete**
  - Publish accepted RTP PCMU payloads before decoding rather than re-encoding
    decoded PCM.
  - Preserve RTP sequence, timestamp, discontinuity, observation, and endpoint
    information needed by local clients.
  - Keep packet acceptance and decoded-PCM routing under one authoritative
    network-audio session.
- **Independent bounded subscriptions — complete**
  - Give every audio subscriber an independent bounded queue and deterministic
    close and unsubscribe behavior.
  - Isolate slow, disconnected, malformed, and excess clients without delaying
    RTP reception, scanner control, PSI, daemon events, or other subscribers.
  - Expose packet loss, queue overflow, discontinuity, and subscriber-health
    state through immutable snapshots or transitions.
- **Private local delivery — complete**
  - Add a versioned local PCMU subscription contract without changing the
    existing request-response API or ordered event-stream protocols.
  - Bound client count, queued packets, payload and frame sizes, write waits, and
    shutdown deadlines.
  - Preserve private Unix-socket ownership, safe stale-socket handling, and
    deterministic daemon-process lifecycle integration.
- **Regression, documentation, and hardware validation — in progress**
  - Cover packet ordering, sequence wraparound, loss and discontinuity,
    independent clients, overflow, disconnect races, size limits, and bounded
    shutdown.
  - Document framing, capabilities, resynchronization, exclusions, and client
    behavior.
  - Validate simultaneous API, event, and PCMU clients against a physical SDS200
    without interrupting decoded audio or scanner ownership.

## Deferred hardware validation

### SDS150 physical validation

Physical SDS150 validation is deferred until representative hardware is available.
It does not block v0.16.0.

When hardware becomes available:

- validate model detection and USB serial control;
- validate battery and charge reporting;
- validate navigation and PSI state;
- record tested firmware and transport evidence;
- document any limits that differ from modeled or fixture-tested behavior.

Until then, documentation must describe SDS150 support as implemented or
fixture-tested, not hardware-validated.

## Future milestone candidates

These milestone groups preserve intended future work. Their numbering and release
assignment may change before implementation begins.

### Milestone 19.8 — Safe daemon controls

- Add explicit capability-checked scanner operations such as hold, resume, next,
  previous, and reconnect.
- Correlate requests with authoritative completion or rejection responses and
  serialize conflicting operations.
- Do not expose unrestricted raw scanner-command passthrough initially.

### Milestone 19.9 — CLI daemon client

- Add daemon status, snapshot, event-watch, safe-control, and optional audio
  client workflows.
- Preserve explicit daemon and standalone selection with clear absent,
  incompatible, and disconnected daemon diagnostics.
- Use the CLI migration to validate protocol compatibility before TUI adoption.

### Milestone 19.10 — TUI daemon client

- Consume daemon snapshots, ordered events, controls, and daemon-owned audio.
- Preserve an explicit standalone mode and show daemon protocol, connection,
  reconnect, and degraded-state information.
- Ensure closing or reconnecting the TUI never stops the daemon-owned scanner
  session.

### Milestone 19.11 — Destination activation and reload

- Activate saved playback, recording, and remote-stream destinations under daemon
  ownership.
- Define validated, previewable configuration replacement and failure-isolated
  destination updates.
- Assign `SIGHUP` reload behavior only after deterministic reload and rollback
  contracts exist.

### Milestone 19.12 — v0.19.0 release

- Complete compatibility, migration, deployment, and systemd documentation.
- Validate multiple clients, slow and malformed clients, shutdown fault
  injection, clean installation, and upgrade behavior.
- Run full Python 3.11–3.14 CI and CodeQL validation plus physical SDS200
  daemon-owned CLI and TUI client testing.

Keep the existing Python import package compatible until a separate migration
plan justifies a rename.

### Milestone 20 — Web dashboard and Home Assistant

- Add a responsive browser dashboard backed by the daemon API.
- Bind to localhost by default.
- Require explicit authentication and transport-security planning before remote
  exposure.
- Expose scanner state, connection health, audio state, recordings, logs, and safe
  controls.
- Add Home Assistant integration through the daemon API rather than opening a
  second scanner connection.
- Evaluate HACS distribution after the integration contract stabilizes.

### Milestone 21 — Favorites Workspace foundation

- Add a renderer-neutral Favorites data model.
- Add read-only hierarchy browsing for Favorites Lists, systems, departments,
  sites, and channels.
- Add search, filtering, validation, and comparison views.
- Add import and export formats that preserve unknown scanner fields.
- Keep the first implementation read-only against scanner storage.
- Use fixtures and copied storage images for normal automated tests.

### Milestone 22 — Verified Favorites writes and storage backends

- Add create, edit, and delete workflows with explicit previews.
- Support USB mass-storage discovery and safe device handling.
- Support FTP only on trusted local networks or VPNs.
- Require a complete backup before every write operation.
- Stage writes away from the active data set.
- Read back and verify staged content before replacement.
- Record rollback manifests and restore instructions.
- Detect concurrent changes and refuse ambiguous overwrites.
- Keep write operations deterministic, recoverable, and auditable.

### Milestone 23 — External Favorites data and synchronization

- Add RadioReference-assisted import with update previews.
- Preserve provenance and field ownership for externally sourced data.
- Support merge decisions and detaching local records from an external source.
- Store credentials and application keys outside exported Favorites data.
- Investigate MyRR synchronization only through an approved and documented
  interface.
- Do not scrape or depend on undocumented private interfaces.

### Milestone 24 — Advanced protocol and analysis modes

Research and fixture work must precede public support for:

- Favorites and hierarchy retrieval such as `GLT`;
- Favorites quick keys such as `FQK`;
- Quick Search control such as `QSH`;
- scanner recording control such as `URC`;
- analysis controls such as `AST` and `APR`;
- waterfall data such as `PWF` and `GWF`;
- menu operations such as `MNU`, `MSI`, `MSV`, and `MSB`;
- additional NAC, RAN, color-code, area, activity, and quality details;
- conventional and trunking discovery modes;
- system-status and RF-power plot screens.

Each feature must preserve unknown fields and include captured or synthetic
fixtures before renderer-specific implementation.

### Milestone 25 — Portability and additional interfaces

- Continue prioritizing Linux and Raspberry Pi operation.
- Validate Windows and macOS behavior without blocking current releases.
- Consider a future desktop GUI over the same renderer-neutral services.
- Preserve the option for an LCARS-inspired interface theme.
- Prefer scalable SVG assets and responsive layouts.
- Treat the Raspberry Pi 7-inch 800 by 480 display as a compact reference layout,
  not a universal fixed resolution.
